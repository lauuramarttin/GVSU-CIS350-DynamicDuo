# Introduction

Our project focuses on creating a simple train and passenger management system using Python and a database. The main idea is to build an easy-to-use application that helps manage train schedules and passenger trips. By using a database, we can store and retrieve information reliably, making the app more efficient. This system will allow users to add new trips for passengers, remove trips they no longer need, and view trip information easily.

We also plan to design a friendly front-end that makes it simple for users to navigate the system. The application will be built with the user in mind, ensuring all features are straightforward and accessible. By offering tools for managing trips and retrieving data quickly, our system aims to make traveling easier for both railway companies and passengers.

Loosely Defined Features:
- Add New Trip: Users can enter details for new trips, like train info and passenger names.
- Remove Trip: Users can delete a trip from the system when itâ€™s no longer needed.
- View Passenger Trips: Passengers can check their travel history and upcoming trips.
- List Passengers by Train: Staff can see a list of all passengers booked on a specific train.
