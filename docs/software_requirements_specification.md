# Software Requirements Specification

## Overview
This document outlines the software requirements for the train and passenger management system. It details the functional and non-functional requirements that guide the development process to ensure a robust and efficient application.

## Functional Requirements

1. **User Authentication**
   1. Users must be able to create an account with valid credentials (username and password).
   2. Users must be able to log in using their credentials.

2. **Trip Management**
   1. Users must be able to add a new trip for a passenger.
   2. Users must be able to remove an existing trip.
   3. The system must allow users to view all trips associated with a specific passenger.

3. **Passenger Management**
   1. Users must be able to view a list of all passengers on a specific train.
   2. The system must allow users to search for a passenger by name.
      
4. **Database Management**
   1. The system must store passenger and trip data in a relational database.
   2. The database must support foreign key constraints to maintain data integrity between passengers and trips.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**
   1. The system must support at least 100 simultaneous users without performance degradation.
   2. Response time for user actions must be less than 2 seconds under normal load conditions.

2. **Usability**
   1. The user interface must be intuitive and easy to navigate for all user levels.
   2. Documentation and help features must be provided to assist users in navigating the system.

3. **Security**
   1. User data must be encrypted.
   2. Only authorized users should be able to perform database write operations.

4. **Maintainability**
   1. The database schema must be designed in a way that allows easy updates and future expansion.
