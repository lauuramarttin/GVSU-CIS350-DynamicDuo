# Introduction

Our project focuses on creating a simple train and passenger management system using Python and a database. The main idea is to build an easy-to-use application that helps manage train schedules and passenger trips. By using a database, we can store and retrieve information reliably, making the app more efficient. This system will allow users to add new trips for passengers, remove trips they no longer need, and view trip information easily.

We also plan to design a friendly front-end that makes it simple for users to navigate the system. The application will be built with the user in mind, ensuring all features are straightforward and accessible. By offering tools for managing trips and retrieving data quickly, our system aims to make traveling easier for both railway companies and passengers.

Loosely Defined Features:
- Add New Trip: Users can enter details for new trips, like train info and passenger names.
- Remove Trip: Users can delete a trip from the system when it’s no longer needed.
- View Passenger Trips: Passengers can check their travel history and upcoming trips.
- List Passengers by Train: Staff can see a list of all passengers booked on a specific train.

# Anticipated Technologies

Python: The primary programming language for backend development.
SQL: A database management system for storing and querying data.
HTML and CSS: Technologies for creating the frontend, defining structure and style.
Git: A version control tool for managing the code.
Trello: A project management tool for organizing tasks and collaboration.


# Method/Approach

We will develop the train and passenger management system using the Agile methodology, which allows us to adapt to changes and focus on iterative development. Each sprint will begin with planning sessions to prioritize tasks, such as adding and removing passenger trips. We will implement weekly meetings to ensure clear communication and address any challenges. At the end of each sprint, we’ll review our progress with Praharsha to gather feedback and make necessary adjustments. This flexible approach will help us create a high-quality product that meets user needs and aligns with project goals.

# Estimated Timeline

- Week 1: Define the Idea and Choose Functions: Define the project's objectives and select the key functionalities of the system.
- Week 2: Organization and Task Distribution: Distribute responsibilities among team members.
- Week 3: Develop the Database: Design and create the database structure using SQL.
- Week 4-6: Develop the Backend and Perform Backend Testing: Code the program with classes and fucntions in python and then test to verify it works correctly.
- Week 7-8:	Develop the Frontend: Create the user interface using HTML and CSS.
- Week 9:	Perform Frontend Testing and Collect Feedback:	Test the functionality and usability of the frontend.
- Week 10: Implement Improvements and Documentation

# Anticipated Problems

Data Management: We must ensure data integrity and security by implementing proper validation and error handling to prevent data loss.

Integration Issues: Seamless integration of the frontend and backend may be difficult due to discrepancies in data formats or API responses, requiring thorough testing and clear communication.

Frontend Development Challenges: Our lack of experience in frontend development could lead to difficulties in creating responsive designs and ensuring compatibility.

Time Management: Balancing tasks within our 11-week timeline may be challenging, especially if unexpected delays arise, so we need to remain flexible and adapt our schedule as needed.
