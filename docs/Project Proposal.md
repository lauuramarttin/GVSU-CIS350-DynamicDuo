## Introduction

This project aims to develop a train management system in C++ to handle passenger travel logistics for a transportation company. The program reads initial data from files, including train, wagon, and passenger details, and provides functionalities to manage passenger trips and trains efficiently. The system will allow users to add or remove a passenger's trip, display a passenger's travel history, show passengers on a specific train and list all passengers in alphabetical order. 
After completing the core backend in C++, we also plan to design a friendly front-end that makes it simple for users to navigate the system. The application will be built with the user in mind, ensuring all features are straightforward and accessible. 
By offering tools for managing trips and retrieving data quickly, our system aims to make traveling easier for both railway companies and passengers.

Loosely Defined Features:
* Add a new passenger’s trip to a train: Users can enter details for new trips, like train info and passenger names.
* Remove a passenger’s trip from a train: Users can delete a trip from the system when it’s no longer needed.
* Display a passenger’s travel history: Passengers can check their travel history and upcoming trips.
* List passengers on a specific train and sort passengers alphabetically: Staff can see a list of all passengers booked on a specific train.

## Anticipated Technologies

* Git: A version control tool for managing the code.
* Trello: A project management tool for organizing tasks and collaboration.
* C++: For backend development, data handling, and algorithm implementation.
* HTML/CSS/JavaScript: To create a responsive web-based frontend.
* File I/O: Text file handling in C++ for reading initial data and exporting results

# Method/Approach

* Backend Development in C++: Build core functions to handle trip and passenger management, including reading and storing data in lists and maps.
* Text File Integration: Implement C++ functions to read from input files and write results to output files.
* Frontend Design: Develop a web interface to display train, wagon, and passenger information dynamically.
* Integration: Connect frontend with C++ backend for real-time data handling

For this project, we will use an Agile methodology that promotes continuous coding, testing, and iterative improvement. A Kanban approach will work well, as it allows us to visualize progress on a board, prioritize specific tasks, and add new ones flexibly. Kanban's continuous delivery model enables coding and testing small features or functions independently before integrating them into the main system.

# Estimated Timeline

* Week 1: Define the Idea, requirements and features: Define the project's objectives and select the key functionalities of the system.
* Week 2: Organization and Task Distribution: Distribute responsibilities among team members, assign roles and divide tasks.
* Week 3: Initial Coding and Setup: Begin implementing the foundational classes (Train, Passenger, Trip, Wagon) and the core readInitialData function to load data from files into these structures.
* Weeks 4-6: Develop the Backend and Perform Backend Testing:  Implement Core Functions beginning with essential operations like adding/removing trips, listing passengers on a train, displaying a passenger's trips, and ordering passengers alphabetically across trains and then test to verify it works correctly.
* Weeks 7-9: Develop the Frontend: Create the user interface using HTML and CSS.
* Week 10:	Perform Frontend Testing and Collect Feedback:	Test the functionality and usability of the frontend.
* Week 11: Implement Improvements and Documentation

# Anticipated Problems

* Data Management: We must ensure data integrity and security by implementing proper validation and error handling to prevent data loss.
* Integration Issues: Seamless integration of the frontend and backend may be difficult due to discrepancies in data formats or API responses, requiring thorough testing and clear communication.
* Frontend Development Challenges: Our lack of experience in frontend development could lead to difficulties in creating responsive designs and ensuring compatibility.
* Time Management: Balancing tasks within our 11-week timeline may be challenging, especially if unexpected delays arise, so we need to remain flexible and adapt our schedule as needed.
