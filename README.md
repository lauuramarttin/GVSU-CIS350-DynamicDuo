# Dynamic Duo

Train Network App

Our project focuses on developing a train and passenger management system using Python and a database to store and manage travel information. This system allows us to add new trips for passengers, remove existing trips, and query both the trips of a specific passenger and the list of passengers on a particular train. By implementing a database, we can keep the data organized and persistently accessible, improving the efficiency of the system.
