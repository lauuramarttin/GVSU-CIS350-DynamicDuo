TrainHub Website

This project uses C++ to simulate a train network, with core functionality to read initial data from text files to populate a train list and passenger map. Key functions will include adding/removing passenger trips, displaying passenger trip details and listing passengers on specific trains. Following the C++ backend, a frontend website will be developed to present and manage this data interactively for users
